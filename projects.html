                    &emsp;The above project was my final assignment for my capstone class at Gaston. 
                    This is a project coded in C# meant to help my older brother out with his scheduling for the company he works at.
                    Here I gathered a group of employees from a SQL database I made and then hosted myself on 
                    AWS (Amazon web services). The objective of the assignment was to access the database through C# code
                    allowing the user to create, edit, and delete current employees with their schedules schedules.
                    The windows application included 3 different forms. A login box, the main view form(pictured above), and a specific employee edit form.
                    This project intrueged me enough to start learning ASP.NET in order to remake this applicaiton into a usable website.

                    &emsp;The above project was another section of my final capstone project.
                    Here I needed to edit the relationship of certain emplyees with their positions
                    inside the store. Here the user would login using a basic connection to the online AWS server.
                    From here the user can add or change the position each employee is in based on the

                <p>
                    &emsp;This website is made and designed by me entirely from scratch using Visual Studio Code and hosted with Git.
                    I wanted to prove a point with this site showing I understand basic HTML5 and CSS. Here I hope to prove to any employers that I understand
                    what I am doing and can prove to be a valuable asset to your team. Here is some of what I wrote for the home page!
                </p>

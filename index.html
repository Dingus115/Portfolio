                    <p>
                        &emsp;I am a application development major from Gaston Community College based in Dallas NC.
                        I have worked in a development field for almost a year now with intermediate knowledge in SQL/MySQL and C# development languages with some experience in C++, Java, Python, HTML5, CSS, and kotlin.
                        My IDE of choice is visual studio or eclipse.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;I mainly code in C# and Java but love to work in other languages for the experience/variety. Languages I currently have some experience in include C++, Python, HTML5, CSS, and Kotlin.
                        For C# I have mainly worked in WinForms and console apps for creating applications that save/delete/edit and move database entries.
                        For Java I have some experience when creating GUI applications but have mainly edited database in smaller console applications. 
                        I am currently learning and have some experience in ASP.NET, with my current goal to take my Capstone project and turn it from a Windows apllication to a website.

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;I love to code and play music. I started coding in 2017 in a python based website called Scratch. 
                    There I learned the basic concepets of programming and was fascinated with the idea of getting a computer to do what I say.
                    After graduatiing high-school I went to WCU and studied music for 3 years with some more programming experience in Python.
                    I then transfered to Gaston Community college in 2020 to follow a career in Application developement where I studied C#, Java, C++, Python, HTML5, CSS, and Kotlin.
                    The courses at Gaston Community college mainly focused on teachingadvanced concepts dealing with C# and Java with giving students some experience in other languages mentioned before. 
                    The final lessons in the course showed GUI programming along with asking students to learn some form of SQL on their own.

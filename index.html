            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;I love to code and play music. I started coding in 2017 in a python based website called Scratch. 
                There I learned the basic concepets of programming and was fascinated with the idea of getting a computer to do what I say.
                After graduatiing high-school I went to WCU and studied music for 3 years with some more programming experience in Python.
                I then transfered to Gaston Community college in 2020 to follow a career in Application developement where I studied C#, Java, C++, Python, HTML5, CSS, and Kotlin.
                The course mainly focused on teaching C# and Java
